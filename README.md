# Bootstrap 5 + WebPack 5 + Handlebars

Basic BS, WP and HDS setup for a portfolio assignment. Future version if I decide to spend real time on it will be completely different. Used `https://github.com/noreading/bootstrap5-webpack-boilerplate.git` as a starting point and used Handlebars to chunk out some partials. Very minimal BS var config and generally used BS utility classes and built in components to scaffold everything out.
