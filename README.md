# Bootstrap 5 + WebPack 5 + Handlebars

Basic BS, WP and HDS setup for a portfolio assignment. Future version if I decide to spend real time on it will be on a diff stack entirely (when there's time).

Used `https://github.com/noreading/bootstrap5-webpack-boilerplate.git` as a starting point to skip the need to add and configure a build system. 

All the html files and BS markup was added.
